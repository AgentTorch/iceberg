43-2011.00,"Switchboard Operators, Including Answering Service",ADMINISTRATIVE_SUPPORT_WASTE_SERVICES,8.0,"Switchboard operators face high software automation risk as their core duties involve templated data entry (call logging, message recording), rule-based admin workflows (following standard call routing procedures), and standardized correspondence generation (taking and relaying messages). These tasks align directly with vulnerable duties identified in the premises. While some human interaction remains important, the technical aspects of call routing and data processing are highly automatable.",8.5,"With robotics integration, switchboard operations face even higher automation risk. Voice recognition systems and automated call routing can handle most standard inquiries and transfers. Physical tasks like mail processing and visitor badge management could be automated with robotics. The combination of AI-powered voice systems and robotic process automation could replace most switchboard functions, leaving only complex customer service scenarios requiring human intervention.",7.5,6.0,"Administrative support services typically adopt software automation relatively quickly due to clear cost savings and efficiency gains. However, robotics adoption is slower due to higher upfront costs and the need for infrastructure changes in office environments. Many organizations are already implementing automated phone systems and chatbots."
25-1123.00,"English Language and Literature Teachers, Postsecondary",EDUCATIONAL_SERVICES,3.0,"English Literature professors engage in high-stakes ethical/legal judgment in academic evaluation, deep domain expertise in literary analysis and criticism, relationship building with students, and creative thinking in curriculum design. While some administrative tasks like grading and record-keeping could be automated, the core teaching, mentoring, and scholarly activities require human creativity, empathy, and complex interpretation that resist automation.",2.0,"Adding robotics capabilities doesn't significantly increase automation risk for English Literature professors. The role is fundamentally human-centric, requiring creative physical expression in teaching, adaptability in variable classroom environments, and human-centric care and education. Physical robotics offers little advantage for literary analysis, creative writing instruction, or student mentoring activities.",4.0,3.0,"Educational services traditionally adopt technology slowly due to institutional inertia, faculty resistance to change, and emphasis on human interaction. While learning management systems and online tools are gradually adopted, comprehensive automation faces barriers from accreditation requirements, union concerns, and the fundamental belief that education requires human mentorship and creativity."
33-3052.00,Transit and Railroad Police,PASSENGER_TRANSPORTATION,4.0,"Transit and Railroad Police face moderate software automation risk. While some tasks like report writing, data entry, and database management are vulnerable to software automation, the role involves significant high-stakes ethical/legal judgment, complex problem-solving in unpredictable situations, building relationships with the public, and human-centric activities like conflict resolution and emergency response that are protected from automation.",3.0,"With robotics added, the automation risk decreases slightly. While some patrol activities and surveillance tasks could potentially be automated with advanced robotics, the job requires adaptability in variable environments, on-the-fly physical problem solving, human-centric care and safety, and complex interpersonal interactions that are difficult to automate with current robotics technology.",5.0,4.0,"Transportation industry has moderate adoption rates for technology. While software tools for reporting and communication are readily adopted, full automation faces regulatory hurdles, public safety concerns, and union resistance. Law enforcement automation requires extensive testing and public acceptance, slowing implementation."
25-1011.00,"Business Teachers, Postsecondary",EDUCATIONAL_SERVICES,3.0,"Business Teachers, Postsecondary engage in high-stakes ethical/legal judgment, deep domain expertise, relationship building, and creative problem-solving. While some administrative tasks like grading and record-keeping could be automated, the core teaching activities require human connection, complex pedagogical decisions, and adaptability to student needs that are difficult to automate.",2.0,"Adding robotics capabilities doesn't significantly increase automation risk for postsecondary business teachers. The role is fundamentally human-centric, requiring complex interpersonal skills, creative teaching methods, research capabilities, and ethical judgment that remain highly resistant to both software and robotics automation.",6.0,4.0,"Educational services adopt software tools moderately (LMS, grading systems) but slowly for core teaching functions due to institutional conservatism and emphasis on human interaction. Robotics adoption is slower as physical teaching presence and human connection remain valued. Budget constraints and faculty resistance also slow adoption."
11-9199.11,Brownfield Redevelopment Specialists and Site Managers,MANAGEMENT_CONSULTING_SERVICES,3.0,"Brownfield redevelopment specialists engage in complex problem-solving requiring deep domain expertise in environmental science, regulatory compliance, and project management. While some administrative tasks like data entry and report generation could be automated, the core work involves high-stakes ethical/legal judgment, tackling ambiguous environmental problems, and building relationships with stakeholders. The job requires creative thinking for novel remediation solutions and adaptability in variable contaminated environments.",2.0,"Adding robotics capabilities doesn't significantly increase automation risk for this role. The work involves complex environmental assessment requiring human judgment, stakeholder relationship management, and creative problem-solving for unique contamination scenarios. While robots might assist with some site inspection tasks, the core responsibilities of regulatory compliance, project coordination, and strategic planning remain highly human-centric and require adaptability in variable field environments.",5.0,3.0,"Management consulting services typically adopt software tools at moderate pace for efficiency gains, but environmental remediation requires extensive regulatory compliance and safety protocols that slow adoption. Robotics adoption is particularly slow due to the unpredictable, hazardous nature of contaminated sites requiring human expertise and judgment."
